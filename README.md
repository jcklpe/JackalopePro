I've learned a ton since I built my first Wordpress theme last year. 

I've also been told my website is too glitzy and artsy for professional recruiters. Well I intend to make something pretty cute, but I figure it would be nice to start over from scratch and focus on creating something a bit more streamlined. 

Also a chance to learn a bit more about using npm and webpack in Wordpress.
